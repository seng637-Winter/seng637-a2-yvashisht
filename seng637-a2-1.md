# 1 Introduction

For Lab 2, our group was tasked with learning the fundamentals of automated unit testing through black box testing of JFreeChart in Java. Utilizing JUnit, we developed tests based on specific unit requirements, integrating mock objects to simulate real-world scenarios. Our group worked collaboratively to navigate the complexities of testing, with a focus on the practical application of theory to enhance software reliability and quality. The SENG-637 notes from Week 3 and Week 4 were used throughout the lab to guide our group. This report outlines our testing strategy, the test cases we developed, our collaborative process, the challenges we encountered, and our reflections on the lab exercise.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

The unit test strategy consists of four test design types (equivalence class testing, boundary value analysis, robustness testing and worst case testing) which were applied to each method selected to create the test cases. After selecting a method each of these design types and their implementation were considered carefully until a sufficient amount of test cases were created. Equivalence class testing is the process of dividing the input domain of a program into classes of data from which test cases can be derived. An example equivalence class testing test design was applied to the method getLength() in class Range, where a negative range and a zero range were applied. Boundary value analysis is a testing technique that focuses on testing the boundaries or extreme values of input ranges to see how the method handles these values, we applied this test design type on the constrain() method in the class Range, where it failed. Robustness testing is a type of testing that evaluates the ability of a system to maintain functionality under adverse conditions or stressful inputs, an example of robustness testing is seen on the createNumberArray2D() method in the class DataUtilities. Worst case testing is a testing strategy focused on evaluating the performance or behavior of a system under extreme or worst-case scenarios. A clear implementation of worst case testing was applied to the method createNumberArray() in the class Range, where extreme values were applied and the test failed.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The workload associated with this assignment was split evenly. Of the ten methods that required testing, each of the five members wrote and executed various test cases on two of them. Persistent communication was key in ensuring that no two group members overlapped with each other's workload. In some cases, more than one group member would try executing a test case on a certain method to verify that the results being obtained were accurate. 

The workload was also split up for the lab report, with each group member contributing to one of the six required sections, and then everybody collaborating for the section that requires description of each test case and test method.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
1. It ws confusing having so many tests fail - unsure if I wrote my tests incorrectly or if a lot of errors were purposefully added to the code. I kept trying test cases from the assignment that I knew would pass. 
2. Learned how to effectively use JUnit and test methods in Eclipse. 
3. Learned how to implement different types of testing criteria. 
4. I did not realize how time consuming testing was. 

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

1. Collaborating with friends was fun, good to see how other team mates tackled their test cases. 
2. I wish more guidance was given on the types of testing to run. 
3. Our group found the wording for the test method extremely unclear in the assignment instructions. This portion specifically "he next step is to code your test code in the JUnit framework based on the list of test cases you have designed on paper. Each test method should include one test case only". Our team was debating for a long time whether this meant we should only write one unit test per method to be tested, or that each test method should only include on test case.
